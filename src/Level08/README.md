## Level 08 [Workshop]

This exercise introduces the [lens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens)
package. We will be writing some `Lens`es and `Prism`s for our various data
structures, then refactoring some of our code to take advantage of them.

Building up a solid theoretical foundation of what a `lens` is, is beyond the
scope of this level. We will be making use of a far too popular software
development technique of 'cargo-culting'.

This is not to imply that a solid theoretical foundation of lenses is beyond
you, far from it. But there is a more focused and in-depth course that deals
with this subject to a far more satisfying depth. You would be better served by
delving into the details there.

See [lets-lens](https://github.com/data61/lets-lens) for the juicy details.

We have two main goals:

A) Develop your _intuition_ of what a lens is
B) Crush any notion that lenses are super complicated things, used only by
   wizened Haskellers and skittery mathematicians to write inscrutable code.

Our approach is to:

* Discuss some analogies
* Build some
* Use them
